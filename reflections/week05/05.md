# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.


```
Was an ok week. was feeling comfy with mvc then we went and learned the back end of the stack and it was a little of the same but a lot to take in. Just need to keep studying and being more comfortable with coding in general. really need to work on how to do javascript problems 
```
