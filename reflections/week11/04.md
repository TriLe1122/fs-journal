it was fun having another chance to get more comfortable with the back end. i loved being in this course and im a little sad we are almost at the end. i love being a student of jakes and everyone that works there. i hope i can find a nice coding job and then come and visit here often since the people at codeworks is great. Im excited for this final honestly. i get to see if i can really do what a dev could do in a week and its exciting. i loved being in this class and learn this very difficult subject.
