# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

this week started out a little rough since we were down a day and was told that the 3rd week was a tough one. But after really focusing and watching closely i felt i was starting to understand what we wre doing. it wasn't anything really that new, but we were putting our java in different spots in java to help make it more organized and at first i didn't like it but now after doing it a couple of times it makes a lot more sense. i can follow along and the pattern recognition was starting to form in my little brain. I started of the last 2 weeks feeling a little behind and feeling like i wasn't understanding anything but i stuck through it and put in the work and i feel it really paid off. the mvc model was a little off putting when i first saw it but now its a very strong formatting . I also love all the cool things we get with bcw create. we have so many tools and things to use to make our lives easier that even the senior class didn't have access too. I'm feeling good about learning coding now, I  can do this. Ready for week 4.
