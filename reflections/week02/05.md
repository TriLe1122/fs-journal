# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.


      this work was kinda shit for me. i could just not keep up at all with js. i could sometimes get things tp pop up on screen or things to even update but im having problems remembering when i need to use certain words for js. it's hard to even go to a TA because i don't even know where to begin with asking questions. its been a real struggle this week and im not sure i can count anything as a victory this week .

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
