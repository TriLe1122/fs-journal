## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

        scope is what variables is accessible from where.
        if you make a var and its not in anything then its globally available, but if its in a function then its only accessible in that function

        const declarations are block scoped
        let is block scoped
        var is globally scoped

2. What is Hoisting ?

        Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

        let needs to be declared before being called upon before unlike var


        In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

        const for when it will not be updated or redefined 

        let is var but better in everyway. it is used block scoped but cant be declared more than once while var can be 
      let can also be updated but not re-declared
