## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?


        having a plan will help you not get sidetracked and waste time. knowing how you want to tackle the problem will save a lot of time and not get deviated. dont do things blindly. having a plan will never put you in a bad spot

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

        talk to other people, my peers or google. everyone has a different way of thinking of and doing things and what makes sense to someone else might not make sense to you. talk to people, google if others have had the same problems and if they were able to find solutions. google is a very big database.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?



        coding is very hard and for new people it will be stressful. but talk to other programmers and take breaks and dont be a "noob".
        dont overcomplicate things and try to think of the end product and not overcomplicate things. use your dev tools and take coding feedback.
