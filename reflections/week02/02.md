## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

          There are 3 ways of writing a function in JavaScript:

          Function Declaration - is a  named function and is hoisted (allowing the function to be used before it is defined)

          Function Expression - A Function Expressions defines a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that has no name. Function Expressions are not hoisted, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined

          Arrow Function - An Arrow Function Expression is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

          Arguments, , are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed (invoked).
            ex-  const """"arg1"""" = true;
          const """"arg2"""" = false;

        Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition.

          A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value.


3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

        Higher Orders Functions are functions that perform operations on other functions.

        EX-  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        function addOne(array) {
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            console.log(array[i] + 1);
          }
        }

        addOne(numbers);
