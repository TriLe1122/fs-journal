## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

          - console.log() should be used when you want to know when  something is happening and what it is.
        - console.error() when you have an error happening in your code or received from an API  you can distinguish the source.



2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

        the elements tab. its great because you can go thru each line and alter it in the dev tools but if you refresh you can reset your code, but u can also copy and paste any changes you made in the actual dev tools and put it in your  code and it will be permenantly saved 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

        in the console their will be error messages that will show what line of code isn't working or isn't defined etc. that will be most useful when debugging
