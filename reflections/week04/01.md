> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
```
messy looking code, usually caused when people write code to make things happen from top to bottom
```

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

```
asynchronous means code that happens independantly from other code, it doesnt have to happen through a line, it can happen when it needs to. callbacks are involved because async codes are sometimes ran when being called back upon
```

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
```
keep it shallow - having good naming conventions helps fine code easier ,and splitting it up makes it easier to read and find


modulize - have small moduals do one thing and assemble like ones to do a bigger thing. its cleaner and easier to read and find, dont give moduals too many jobs, this is the most important

handle every single error -
making sure your code is readable is important, but that wont mean anything unless your code is stable and works. go through your code and make sure no errors come up. code small, test small, debug small.
