2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

<!-- specificity is how css will make your things look if there are multiple things affecting the same thing. the way to call to them gives them different weight and that weight determines if it will be called upon for the code. the thing with the most weight will take priority. we can use it to our benefit by knowing what the weight of certain things are and then we can style specific things without targeting another -->
