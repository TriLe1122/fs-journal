2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

web designer sites, bootstrap themes and just looking around at websites for inspiration

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

you eat with your eyes before anything. so a nice, clean page before interaction will have an effect if someone wants to be on the site or not. you could convey what type of site it'll be by design alone
