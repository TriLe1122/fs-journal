# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

this week has been very insightful in the life of a developer. I learned how to structure html and add css to it. we got bootstrap working and learned how to use bootstrap. it has a lot of things it can do on its own. i don't have to use bootstrap but i like that it makes things a lot easier and it follows a universal guideline. i can still use css if i need to be more specific or do more specific changes. 
I love the idea of structuring out a site before even adding anything to it. a good game plan will set anyone up for success. i need to be better about note taking and what is important but theres so much information and it feels we have barely scratched the surface on anything really.
besides the note taking im feeling pretty good about this. just take it one step at a time and don't get overwhelmed and to take breaks and even ask more questions
